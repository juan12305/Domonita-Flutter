# TODO: Unify Design Across Flutter App Pages

## Tasks
- [ ] Update login_page.dart: Change the gradient to match the day colors from control_page.dart for coherence.
- [ ] Update register_page.dart: Change the gradient to match the day colors from control_page.dart for coherence.
- [ ] Update control_page.dart: Add the particle system background from login/register pages to maintain the connected aesthetic while keeping the light-based gradient effect.
- [ ] Test the app to ensure all pages have a unified look and the control page retains its dynamic light-based colors.

## Notes
- Keep the existing particle system in login and register.
- Ensure animations and fonts remain consistent.
- The control page's gradient should remain dynamic based on light sensor data.
